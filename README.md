# conscribe [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/johnsonnc/conscribe.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/johnsonnc/conscribe)

Combine JSON Schema and Markdown

## The issue

In trying to find a solution to combine schema based API/ OWF Channels and documentation, it was found that JSDOC wasn't quite up to
the task of documenting it how we thought it should. 

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install conscribe` (Not published yet so I wouldn't try it.)

```javascript
var conscribe = require('conscribe');
conscribe.[yet to be decided](); 
```

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
